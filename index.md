  content: We created Dripl because we wanted to find out if we could build a profitable
    internet business together. Between us, we spent 20 years at startups. This means:<br><br><strong>Half
    of Dripl is an un-startup</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br><br></span>We
    are building digital products but we are not seeking hockey stick growth, looking
    for venture capital or working 100-hour weeks.<br><br><strong>Half of Dripl is
    a consulting agency<br></strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br></span>We
    advise clients on adopting Lean Startup principles in the enterprise. This helps
    us fund the un-startup, but we are also very good at this.

  content: <p>About <strong>175,000</strong> people take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_the_United_Kingdom_test">Life
    in the UK test</a> every year to qualify for residence. Ainy was one of them last
    year. She tried several apps on the App Store to help her prepare for the test
    but didn't like any of them so we decided to build an app she would love.<br><br>During
    research, we found that <strong>5 out of the top 20</strong> best-selling apps
    on the App Store were for test-preparation so we took a step back &amp; built
    an engine that transforms a spreadsheet of multiple-choice questions into a beautiful,
    singing-and-dancing test-preparation app for the iPhone.<br><br>We are dogfooding
    the engine to build an app for the Life in the UK test. This will be followed
    by more test-preparation apps until we feel we have something reproducible. At
    this point, we might launch the engine as a <strong>no-code solution for building
    test-preparation apps.</strong></p>
