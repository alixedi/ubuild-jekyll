  headline: "<strong>The story, so far</strong>"
  content: We created Dripl because we wanted to find out if we could build a profitable
    internet business together. Between us, we spent 20 years at startups. This means:<br><br><strong>Half
    of Dripl is an un-startup</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br><br></span>We
    are building digital products but we are not seeking hockey stick growth, looking
    for venture capital or working 100-hour weeks.<br><br><strong>Half of Dripl is
    a consulting agency<br></strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br></span>We
    advise clients on adopting Lean Startup principles in the enterprise. This helps
    us fund the un-startup, but we are also very good at this.

    the UK are test-preparation apps. <br><br>We have built a software that transforms
    spreadsheets containing question banks into beautiful, singing-and-dancing test-preparation
    apps for the iPhone. At the touch of a button.<br><br>We have used this software
    to ship 6 apps to the App Store. Shipping the last 4 apps took us less than a
    month.</p>"
